The purpose of electro-mechanical modeling is to model and simulate an electro-mechanical system, such that its physical parameters can be examined before the actual system is built. Parameter estimation and physical realization of the overall system is the major design objective of Electro-Mechanical modeling. Theory driven mathematical model can be used or applied to other system to judge the performance of the joint system as a whole. This is a well known & proven technique for designing large control system for industrial as well as academic multi-disciplinary complex system. This technique is also being employed in MEMS technology recently.

If all forces are derivable from a potential, then the time behavior of the dynamical systems is completely determined. For simple mechanical systems, the Lagrangian is defined as the difference of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. There exists a similar approach for electrical system. By means of the electrical co-energy and well defined power quantities, the equations of motions are uniquely defined. The currents of the inductors and the voltage drops across the capacitors play the role of the generalized coordinates. All constraints, for instance caused by the Kirchhoff laws, are eliminated from the considerations. After that, a suitable transfer function is to be derived from the system parameters which eventually governs the behavior of the system. In consequence, we have quantities (kinetic and potential energy, generalized forces) which determine the mechanical part and quantities (co-energy, powers) for the description of the electrical part. This offers a combination of the mechanical and electrical parts by means of an energy approach. As a result, an extended Lagrangian format is produced. Books[edit] Dean C. Karnopp; Donald L.
