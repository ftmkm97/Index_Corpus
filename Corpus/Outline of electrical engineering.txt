See also: Index of electrical engineering articles Overview of and topical guide to electrical engineering The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to electrical engineering. Electrical engineering – field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. The field first became an identifiable occupation in the late nineteenth century after commercialization of the electric telegraph and electrical power supply. It now covers a range of subtopics including power, electronics, control systems, signal processing and telecommunications. .mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Contents 1 Classification 2 Branches of electrical engineering 3 Related disciplines 4 History of electrical engineering 5 General electrical engineering concepts 5.1 Electromagnetism 5.2 Physical laws 5.3 Control engineering 5.4 Electronics 5.5 Power engineering 5.6 Electric vehicles 5.7 Signal processing 5.8 Instrumentation 5.9 Telecommunication 6 Electrical engineering occupations 7 Electrical engineering organizations 8 Electrical engineering publications 9 Persons influential in electrical engineering 10 See also 11 References 12 External links Classification[edit] Electrical engineering can be described as all of the following: Academic discipline – branch of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. Branch of engineering – discipline, skill, and profession of acquiring and applying scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge, in order to design and build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes.
