The Cheng cycle involves the heated exhaust gas from the turbine being used to make steam in a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).[1] The steam so produced is injected into the gas turbine's combustion chamber to increase power output.[2] The process can be thought of as a parallel combination of the gas turbine Brayton cycle and a steam turbine Rankine cycle.[3][4] The cycle was invented by Prof. D. Y. Cheng of the University of Santa Clara who patented it in 1976.[5][6] See also[edit] Combined cycle Brayton cycle Rankine cycle Cogeneration References[edit] ^ Penning, F. M. and de Lange, F. M.
