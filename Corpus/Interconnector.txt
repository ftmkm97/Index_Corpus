An interconnector is a structure which enables energy to flow between networks. The term is used more specifically to refer to international connections between electricity and natural gas networks. Contents 1 Economy 2 Infrastructure 3 See also 4 References Economy[edit] Interconnectors allow the trading of energy between territories. For example, the North Sea Interconnector allows the trading of natural gas between the UK and Belgium[1] and the Eastâ€“West Interconnector allows the trading of electricity between the UK and the Ireland. A territory which generates more energy than it requires for its own activities can therefore sell surplus energy to a neighbouring territory. Interconnectors also provide increased resilience. Within the European Union there is a movement towards a single market for energy, which makes interconnectors viable.[2] As such, the Nordic and Baltic energy exchange Nord Pool Spot rely on multiple interconnectors. The fullest possible implementation of this is the proposed European super grid which would include numerous interconnectors between national networks. Infrastructure[edit] Interconnectors may run across a land border or connect two land areas separated by water.
