(October 2017) Analysis software for lightning protection used on a power substation. Power engineering software is software used to create models, analyze or calculate the design of Power stations, Overhead power lines, Transmission towers, Electrical grids, Grounding and Lightning[clarification needed] systems and others. It is a type of application software which is used for power engineering problems, which are transformed into mathematical expressions.

The first software were created for monitoring power plants. In the next decades the Power engineering and Computer technologies are develop very fast. It were created and software,to collect the data for the power plants.[1] One of the first computer languages,which were used in the Nuclear plants and in the Thermal plants were C (programming language). In the next years the programming language Python were used,to be create algorithms and software programs. In French Nuclear plants one of the most using computer languages is Python. In the end of 80s were developed the first programs and platforms for electrical power modelling.[2] Power plants analysis software[edit] 3D modeling grounding grid After 2000 begins to develop rapidly analytical programming and 3D modeling. Software products are being created for design power plants and their elements and connections. Programs are based on mathematical algorithms and computations.[3] Power software as ETAP, CYME, DINIS, IPSA, PSS/E and DIgSILENT are pioneers at the category power engineering software. Most of this product used MARKAL, ESME and other modelling methods. The transmission lines be designed according to minimum requirements set out in the SQSS (security and quality of supply standard). This also applies to other elements of the power systems. In the software world,were developed many CAD software products for 2D and 3D electrical design.[4] Renewable energy controller software[edit] The controllers of Renewable energy used different software. The digital controllers are different types: ADC, DAC, 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, and many others.[5] The controllers most of the time to this date are programmed with computer languages like:C,C++,Java and others.[6] Software products[edit] System Creator Development started Latest stable version License Notes NEPLAN NEPLAN AG 1988 10.8.1.2 commercial Cloud Computing[7], Power System Analysis, Power Management System, Grid Code, Real Time integrations, Transmission and Distribution networks, GIS/SCADA integrations, Asset Management, EMS - DMS NAP Innovation Energie Développement 1990 4.01 commercial Transmission & Distribution analysis and planning, Network load flow, power flow, contingency analysis, stability calculation GAP Innovation Energie Développement 1990 3.1 commercial Generation analysis and planning, Diagnosis and analysis of the electrical generation system, introduction of intermittent power sources (PV, Hydro) and storage, interconnections, security of supply , cost and impact of system failures, technical and economic comparative analysis of generation scenario, Evaluation of risk scenarios and planning of maintenance...
